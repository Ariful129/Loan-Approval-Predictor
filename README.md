# Automated Loan Approval Predictor

A machine learning system that automates loan approval decisions by analyzing applicant data and predicting loan approval probability using advanced classification algorithms.

## Features

- **Automated Decision Making**: Predicts loan approval/rejection based on applicant profiles
- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: Implements Random Forest and Logistic Regression models
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature selection and transformation techniques
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and preparation pipeline
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates creditworthiness and default probability

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for model development
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for robust predictions
- **Logistic Regression**: Statistical model for binary classification
- **Feature Engineering**: Data transformation and feature selection
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and preparation

## Dataset Features

The loan approval prediction is based on various applicant characteristics:
- Personal information (age, income, employment status)
- Financial history (credit score, existing debts)
- Loan details (amount, term, purpose)
- Collateral and guarantor information

## Model Performance

The system uses ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy:
- **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions
- **Logistic Regression**: Provides interpretable probability scores
- **Cross-validation**: Ensures model generalization and prevents overfitting
